Key Insights
Following are some key insights from the analysis performed for the year 2023 and two months of 2004 January and February:

Classic bikes are the most popular ride types used equally higher among casual riders as well as member riders. Their usage fluctuates over the year but that coincides with the change in number of trips taken across different months of the year. Electric bikes are also gaining popularity but their usage is slightly lesser than the classic bikes. Docked bikes seem to have been phased out gradually and stopted to use in July 2023.

The average trip durations are higher during the Summer and early Fall months. This correlates with the higher number of trips taken during those months. 

Riders seem to enjoy longer rides during weekends and this trend is consistent across all months of the year.

The average trip durations are higher in early morning hours and evening hours during the weekdays. This can imply that many riders use the Citi Bikes to commute to and from their work, however, that will need more data to confirm this claim. During the weekends, the average trip durations remain higher through out the day which might imply that riders use the bikes for pleasure rides over the weekends.

Questions to Answer:
How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
<How many trips have been recorded in total during the period of 2023>
1,095,125

Average Trip Duration.
What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?
The first step was to compute the average trip duration for 2023 which was 7.026 minutes.

What the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers?
Proportion of short-terms customers -25%, annual subscribers - 75%.

For percentage of total rideship grown we compare two months (Jan, Feb) of 2023 and 2024,
In 2024 number of trips for 1% lesser than in 2023.

The next visualization compares the total rides taken by all riders across different months of the year. Summer and early Fall including June, July, August and September have the highest number of rides.
Compares the average trip durations across different months but also puts details about the weekdays. Across all months, riders tend to enjoy longer rides over the weekends. 

Compares the average duration of trips taken across different weekdays. Weekends clearly have higher trip durations across all months.

 Compares the average trip duration taken over different days of the month. Although for 2023 Overall for 2023, the 1st, 7th, 25th and 30th day of the month recorded the highest average trip duration. However, this trends is different for each month of the year.
 
On Dashboard 2 represented top  10 stations in the city for starting a journey, top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey, the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey, bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey.

During weekdays, riders tend to have longer trips during early morning hours (7-8 am) and evening hours (5-7 pm) which coincides with most commute to work hours.
The average trip duration during the weekends is longer through out the day between 10 am to 7 pm.

 I created a  map which shows how each Start and End Stations. The map has Zip Code Boundaries and Zip Code Number data overlaid on the map. I have also added a layer for 2018 Median Household Income to the map. There are two maps created - one to show the Start Stations data and the second for the End Stations data. Size of the stations depends on count of ride ID.

 I have also created two bar charts to show the top 10 Stations used to Start and End the rides. The top 10 stations are the same for both start and end points.
